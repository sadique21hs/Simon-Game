# Simon Game

## Overview
The Simon Game is a simple yet challenging memory game in which players must repeat an increasingly long sequence of colors. Each level adds a new color to the sequence, and the player must remember and replicate it to advance to the next level. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with jQuery for DOM manipulation.

## How to Play
1. **Start the Game:**
   - Press any key to start the game. The title will change to "Level 0" and the first sequence will begin.

2. **Watch the Sequence:**
   - Observe the sequence of colors and sounds displayed by the game. Each level adds one more color to the sequence.

3. **Repeat the Sequence:**
   - Click the buttons in the order they were presented to replicate the sequence.

4. **Advance to the Next Level:**
   - If you successfully repeat the sequence, you advance to the next level. A new color is added to the sequence.

5. **Game Over:**
   - If you click the wrong button, the game is over. The title will display "Game Over, Press Any Key to Restart." Press any key to start a new game.
